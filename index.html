    <h2 style= border:solid ;color="red">My AkiraChix Experience</h2>
    <p>My experience at AkiraChix started on the very first day that I got admitted here. The Alumni and staff were all warm and welcoming.
        I was shown into a spectacular room whereby I met a whole new set of people who were to be my roommates and sisters the whole of this year.
    It was quiet an an emotional and exciting day since I was going away from home for around ten months, yet I was embarking on a whole new journey.
 </p>
 <h3 style="border:dashed">classes and Routine</h3>
 <p>We were shown into our classes and given laptops. We were also given an oriention on how the school routine and system works.
    I got in sync with how the school routine works and I was ready now to start my journey of becoming a software developer.We were importantly taught how to make our beds in a neat and desirable manner. We were given a timetable to guide us in our day to day activities. We were also given the rules and regulations tha govern and guide the AkiraChix community.
</p>
 <h3 style=" border :dashed">First week </h3>
 <p>On the first week of learning I got introduced to all the units I am supposed to do for the next ten months and to say the least I was intruged. We met the whole of AkiraChix teaching fratenity.I also got to know my classmates and interact with them as we work together towards the common goal.
    All in all my experience has been wholesome. I have had a few bad times too whereby at times I have doubted my capabilities but I learnt to focus on the positive side of this journey. I am looking foward to experincing the AkiraChix life
